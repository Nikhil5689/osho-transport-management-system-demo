# 🚀 OSHO Transport Management System - QUICK START GUIDE

## ✅ Problem FIXED!

Your system had a **data isolation issue** where each device maintained separate data in its local browser storage. 

### What Was Wrong:
- Device 1 added booking → saved in Device 1's localStorage
- Device 2 opened app with same login → showed EMPTY (fresh localStorage)
- Data never synced across devices ❌

### What's Fixed Now:
- **Central Server Database** - All data stored on `server.js` backend
- **Token-Based Auth** - Login tokens persist sessions
- **Real Data Sync** - Changes appear instantly across all devices ✅
- **Multi-Device Support** - Same login works on phone, tablet, desktop, laptop

## 📋 QUICK START (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Navigate to Project Folder
```bash
cd c:\Users\nikhi\Downloads\Nikhil-Softwares\transport-management-system
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (DONE ✓)
✅ Already completed with `npm install`

### Step 3: Start Backend Server
Open **Terminal 1** and run:
```bash
npm run server
```

You should see:
```
✓ Server running on http://localhost:5000
✓ Database stored in: server-data.json
```

**Important:** Leave this terminal running!

### Step 4: Start Frontend (New Terminal)
Open **Terminal 2** and run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
VITE v7.2.4 ready in 123 ms
Local: http://localhost:5173/
```

### Step 5: Open in Browser
Go to: **http://localhost:5173**

### Step 6: Login
```
Username: admin
Password: adminPassword123
```

✅ You're in! All pages are now accessible.

## 🧪 TEST MULTI-DEVICE SYNC (Most Important!)

### Test Setup

**Device 1 (Desktop/Laptop):**
```
http://localhost:5173
```

**Device 2 (Phone/Tablet):**
Find your computer's IP address (run `ipconfig` in terminal, look for IPv4)
```
http://192.168.x.x:5173  (example)
```

### Test Steps

1. **Open on Desktop**
   - Go to http://localhost:5173
   - Login with: admin / adminPassword123

2. **Open on Phone**
   - Go to http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:5173
   - Login with: admin / adminPassword123
   - Both should show the SAME data ✅

3. **Add Booking on Desktop**
   - Create a new booking
   - Note the Way Bill Number

4. **Check Phone**
   - Refresh the page
   - The new booking appears! ✅

5. **Add Payment on Phone**
   - Record a payment for any booking

6. **Check Desktop**
   - Refresh the page
   - The payment is visible! ✅

**Result: Data syncs perfectly across all devices!** 🎉

## 📱 How to Find Your Computer's IP

### Windows:
```bash
ipconfig
```
Look for "IPv4 Address" (usually starts with 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x)

### Mac/Linux:
```bash
ifconfig
```

Then open on phone: `http://YOUR_IP:5173`

## 🗂️ What Changed

### Backend Files (NEW)
```
server.js              ← Express backend server
server-data.json       ← Central database (auto-created)
```

### Frontend Files (UPDATED)
```
src/store/useStore.ts      ← Now connects to backend API
src/utils/api.ts           ← New API client library
src/pages/Login.tsx        ← Updated for async login
src/App.tsx                ← Added token persistence
```

### Configuration (NEW)
```
.env.local             ← API URL configuration
.gitignore             ← Excludes server-data.json
start.bat              ← Windows startup script
```

### package.json (UPDATED)
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "server": "node server.js",      ← NEW
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "cors": "^2.8.5",                ← NEW
    "express": "^4.18.2",            ← NEW
    ...
  }
}
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication System

### Login Flow
```
1. User enters: admin / adminPassword123
2. Sent to backend server for verification
3. Backend creates authentication token
4. Token stored in browser localStorage
5. Token persists until logout
6. All API requests include token in headers
```

### Token Persistence
- When you close and reopen the app, you stay logged in
- Token is automatically restored from localStorage
- Server validates token on every request

---

## 📡 API Structure

All API endpoints are protected with authentication:

### Authentication
```
POST /api/login          → Authenticate user
POST /api/logout         → Clear session
```

### Data Operations
```
GET    /api/clients      → Fetch all clients
POST   /api/clients      → Create client
PUT    /api/clients/:id  → Update client
DELETE /api/clients/:id  → Delete client

GET    /api/bookings     → Fetch all bookings
POST   /api/bookings     → Create booking
PUT    /api/bookings/:id → Update booking
DELETE /api/bookings/:id → Delete booking

GET    /api/payments     → Fetch all payments
POST   /api/payments     → Record payment
PUT    /api/payments/:id → Update payment
DELETE /api/payments/:id → Delete payment

GET    /api/settings     → Get company settings
PUT    /api/settings     → Update settings

GET    /api/waybill/next → Get next way-bill number
```

---

## 🗄️ Database Structure

All data is stored in `server-data.json`:

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "user_admin",
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "[hashed]"
    }
  ],
  "clients": [
    {
      "id": "client_...",
      "name": "Company Name",
      "gst": "22AAAAA0000A1Z5",
      ...
    }
  ],
  "bookings": [
    {
      "id": "booking_...",
      "wayBillNo": "OSHO-1001",
      ...
    }
  ],
  "payments": [
    {
      "id": "pay_...",
      "bookingId": "booking_...",
      ...
    }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "name": "OSHO Transport Chhattisgarh",
    ...
  }
}
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Data Backup
- Keep `server-data.json` safe - it contains all your data!
- Backup regularly: copy the file to cloud storage or external drive
- If file is deleted, restart server to create fresh one with defaults

### Database Persistence
- `server-data.json` created automatically on first run
- Data persists across server restarts
- No external database needed (simple file-based storage)

### Production Deployment
- For production, use a proper database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
- Backend should run on your production server
- Frontend deployed to static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
```bash
# Check if port 5000 is free
# Windows: netstat -ano | findstr :5000
# Kill the process using port 5000
```

### Frontend won't start
```bash
# Port 5173 might be in use
# Vite will automatically try 5174, 5175, etc.
```

### Can't connect from phone
```
1. Ensure both on same WiFi network
2. Check Windows Firewall - allow Node.js
3. Use computer's IP (not localhost)
4. Example: http://192.168.1.100:5173
```

### Data not syncing
```
1. Check if backend is running (should see "Server running on...")
2. Open browser DevTools (F12) → Network tab
3. Check if API requests succeed (green 200 status)
4. Look at Console for error messages
```

### Login fails
```
Credentials are:
- Username: admin
- Password: adminPassword123

Make sure backend server is running!
```

### Lost all data
```
1. Check if server-data.json still exists in project folder
2. If deleted, restart backend - it creates a fresh one
3. To recover: restore backup of server-data.json
```

## ⚡ Next Steps

### For Local Testing
1. ✅ Start both servers (backend + frontend)
2. ✅ Test on desktop browser
3. ✅ Test on mobile with your computer's IP
4. ✅ Create sample data and verify sync

### For Production
1. Deploy backend to cloud (Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean)
2. Build frontend: `npm run build`
3. Deploy `dist/` folder to static hosting
4. Update `REACT_APP_API_URL` to production backend
5. Point custom domain to frontend

### For Database Upgrade (Future)
- Current: File-based storage (`server-data.json`)
- Future: Connect to MongoDB or PostgreSQL for scalability
- See backend code for easy database integration
